## [Live Demo](https://photowall-seven.vercel.app/)

This is a cool little photowall app I built a while back that allows you to upload and comment on photos. If I was to develop this further I would add users & security to control who can push to the database. For now lets agree to stick to pictures of nature and animals!

## Tools:

React, Redux, Firebase

## Quick Start

    1. Git Clone
    2. npm install
    3. npm start

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
